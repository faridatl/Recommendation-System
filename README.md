## Overview:

Welcome to the Recommendation System Project repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to recommend series or films based on user input specifying a particular genre. The series and films are selected from my Netflix viewing history, and recommendations are generated according to the genre provided by the user. The goal is to ensure that the recommendations align accurately with the specified genre.

## üîç Key Features:

* Rigorous data preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers. Initial dataset included the viewing history of 4 profiles (people). Due to time constraint only 1 profile was used in order to truly focus on the "Similar genre" reccomendation aspect of the recommendation system. 
*Employs cosine similarity, a robust machine learning metric, to measure the similarity between user preferences and content genres, facillitating the generation of accurate and personalized recommendations.
*Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to assess and fine-tune predictive models.

## üí° Objective:

* To utilize the collected data to generate insightful recommendations based on a user's viewing history (my own) from Netflix, and determine whether similar genres would be recommended based on that user's profile.
