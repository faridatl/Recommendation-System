## Recommendation System:
Objective: To utilize the collected data to generate insightful recommendations based on a user's viewing history (my own) from Netflix, and determine whether similar genres would be recommended based on that user's profile.

Skills Demonstrated: 

Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: Initial dataset included the viewing history of 4 profiles (people). Due to time constraint only 1 profile was used in order to truly focus on the "Similar genre" reccomendation aspect of the recommendation system. 

Machine learning: Employs cosine similarity, a robust machine learning metric, to measure the similarity between user preferences and content genres, facillitating the generation of accurate and personalized recommendations.
